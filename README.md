# PC6502
My 6502 project in a PC104 like formfactor

This is VERY VERY unstable, I do not know what works and what doesn't.

##CPU Board

This board has a 6502, RAM and ROM on board, along with an ATF1502 for address decoding. There is also a 60-fake-50 (instaled of 6850) which is not my design but emulates the 6850 with USB.
